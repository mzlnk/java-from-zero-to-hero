# Everything you should know about testing

### Why we should write tests?

Tests should always be a part of our project development. But you can ask: why? Everyone make smaller or bigger mistakes - as we are only humans :d However, if we systematically write tests for code which we've recently written, we'll be able to save a lot of time in the future when some - even really small - errors appear and affect half of our project, for example. 

Another reason is the fact that if you write thousands of code, it'll be much harder to find a mistake - even if you use the best and most efficient debuggers. That's  why we should write tests - to test our methods, relations between them, etc. - just to catch small and kind of harmless errors and exceptions.

### How we can write tests?

Don't worry. Writing tests is so common practise that there are lots of different frameworks which can help you maintain your tests. Here, we'll be talking about two of them: [JUnit 5](https://github.com/mzlnk/java-from-zero-to-hero/tree/master/testing/junit "junit") and [Mockito](https://github.com/mzlnk/java-from-zero-to-hero/tree/master/testing/mockito "mockito").
